"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant misses a rental payment then the landlord may issue a 10-Day Notice to Quit. If they do not pay, the landlord may file a Summons and Complaint with the District Judges office."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs, then the landlord may issue a 15-Day Notice to Quit (30-Day for tenants of more than 1 year). Landlords are not legally required to give tenants a chance to remedy the infraction, though it is customary. If the terms are not met, then the landlord may begin eviction proceedings."
"Illegal acts - Pennsylvania law highlight several illegal activities that warrant eviction, such as drugs and prostitution. Landlords can immediately evict and they are not required to give any notice."
