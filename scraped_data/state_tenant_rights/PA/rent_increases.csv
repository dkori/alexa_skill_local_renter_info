"Rent control. Pennsylvania neither preempts nor enforces rent control policies. Thus, landlords may charge what they wish for rent, although rent control policies may be put into place sometime in the future."
"Rental increases. Similarly, landlords are not limited by how much they raise rental prices. They also do not have to give notice or justification for rent hikes."
Rent-related fees. Pennsylvania does not currently regulate late fees although there is a $50 returned check fee limit.
