"Nonpayment of rent - If Louisiana tenants miss a rental payment and surpass any grace period outlined in a lease agreement, then the landlord can send them a 5 Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If these terms are not met, the landlord can start eviction proceedings."
"Violation of lease terms - If a tenant is found violating lease terms, then the landlord can send a 5 Day Notice to Cure or Quit. If the issue is not remedied, then landlords can file a Rule of Possession with the court."
"Illegal acts - If a tenant performs illegal acts on the property, then landlords may issue a 5 Day Notice to Quit that requires the tenant to move out or face evictions. Louisiana landlords may be allowed to evict tenants for illegal acts that do not occur on the property."
