"Rent control. Louisiana has state laws that preempt any kind of rent control policies on a local and state level. As such, landlords can charge as much as they want for rent."
"Rent increases. Similarly, Louisiana does not require landlords to justify or give notice before rent increases. As such, they can raise rental prices whenever they wish."
Rent related fees. Louisiana does not have any regulations on how much landlords can charge for late fees. There are also no limits for returned check fees.
