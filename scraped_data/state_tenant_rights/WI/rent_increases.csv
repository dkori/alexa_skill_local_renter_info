"Rent control. Wisconsin law prohibits rent control policy on both a state and local level, so landlords can charge as much as they want for rent."
"Rental increases. Similarly, landlords are not limited by how much they can raise rent, but they must give at least 28 days of advanced notice."
Rent-related fees. Late fees can be as high as the landlord desires though there is a $20 returned check fee limit.
