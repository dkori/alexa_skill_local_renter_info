"Rent control. New Mexico law prohibits rent control on a state or local level. Thus, landlords are allowed to charge whatever they want for rent."
"Rental increases. New Mexico does not limit by how much landlords can raise rent, but landlords are required to give notice commensurate to how frequently a tenant pays rent."
Rent-related fees. The state limits late fees to 10% of the price of rent for that period. The state also limits returned check fees to $25.
