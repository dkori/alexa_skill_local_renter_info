"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant fails to pay rent, then the landlord may issue a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If the tenant still does not pay, then the landlord may file a Summons and Complaint suit."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs, then the landlord may issue a 7-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. If the tenant does not fix their behavior or evict the premises, then the landlord may file for eviction. If the tenant commits the same violation within 6 months, the landlord can issue an unconditional 7-Day Notice to Quit."
"Illegal acts - If a landlord has documentation of illegal activity on the property, then they may file a 3-Day Notice to Quit. Illegal actions that warrant eviction include possessing or distributing illegal drugs, committing assault or theft, sexual abuse, or causing more than $1,000 in property damage."
