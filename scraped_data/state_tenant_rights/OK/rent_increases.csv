"Rental control. Oklahoma law prohibits any municipal body from passing legislation that amounts to rent control. As such, landlords can charge as much as they want for rent."
Rent increases. There are no rules limiting rent increases or requiring landlords to provide notice or justification before raising the rent. Oklahoma landlords can increase rent whenever they want for any reason.
"Additional fees. There are some statutes prohibiting excessively “punitive” late fees, but no max number is clearly specified. There are no limits to return check fees."
