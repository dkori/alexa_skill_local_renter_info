eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent/lease violation - Maryland does not have separate notification procedures for late rental payments and lease violations. In both cases, the landlord may issue a 14-Day Notice with terms on how to cure the infraction. If the terms of the notice are not met, then the landlord may proceed with eviction."
"Illegal acts - If a tenant is engaging in behavior that presents a “clear and present” danger to the property at large, then the landlord may issue a 14-Day Unconditional Notice to Quit. The landlord does not have to give the tenant a chance to fix their behavior."
