"Rent control. Rhode Island neither enforces nor prohibits rent control. As such, landlords may currently charge whatever they wish in rent but it’s possible that local jurisdictions could instate rent control policies."
Rental increases. Rhode Island landlords are not limited in rent increases but they must give at least 30 days’ notice before increasing rent. Tenants over 62 years of age must receive 60 days’ notice.
"Rent-related fees. Late fees are not limited by the state, as long as fees are clearly laid out in the leasing agreement. Return check fees are limited to no less than $200 but no more than $1,000. The fee is equal to a $25 base fee plus three times the check’s face value."
