"Rent control. Colorado does not currently enforce any rent control policies. Thus, landlords are able to charge whatever they want in rental prices."
Rental increases. Colorado landlords also are allowed to raise rent as high as they want and they are not required to notify or provide justification for rent hikes.
Rent-related fees. Colorado law does not limit the value of late fees as long as the terms are outlined clearly in the lease agreement.
