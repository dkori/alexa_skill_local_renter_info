"Rent control. Wyoming law neither allows for nor prohibits rent control. As such, landlords are currently able to charge as much as they want in rent, though rent control policy is a possibility in the future."
"Rental increases. At the same time, landlords are not limited in how much they raise rental prices and they are not required to give notification or justification for rent hikes."
Rent-related fees. The state does not limit how much landlords can charge for late fees but there is a $30 returned check fee limit.
