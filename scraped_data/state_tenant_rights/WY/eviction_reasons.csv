"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant does not pay rent, the landlord may issue a 3-Day Notice to Quit, after any applicable grace period. If the tenant still does not pay then the landlord may begin eviction proceedings."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs then the landlord may issue a 3-Day Notice to Quit. Wyoming landlords are not required to provide a chance to fix the behavior, although most landlords do. If a Wyoming tenant fails to meet the terms of the notice the landlord may begin formal eviction proceedings."
"Illegal acts - If a Wyoming landlord has evidence of illegal activity taking place on the property, then they may file a 3-Day Unconditional Notice to Quit. Wyoming landlords have broad authority to determine which illegal activities warrant eviction."
