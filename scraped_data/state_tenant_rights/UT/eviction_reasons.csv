eviction_reasons
Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant fails to pay rent then the landlord may issue a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit after any applicable grace period. If the tenant still does not pay then the landlord may file for eviction.
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs, then the landlord may issue a 3-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. In the case of severe violations, there is no need to give the tenant a chance to remedy their behavior. Either way, if the terms are not met, the landlord can pursue formal eviction."
"Illegal acts - Utah landlords have broad authority to determine which illegal activities warrant eviction. To that end, if they have documentation of illegal activities, then the landlord may file a 3-Day Unconditional Notice to Quit."
