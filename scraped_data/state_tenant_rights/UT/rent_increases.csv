"Rent control. Utah law preempts rent control at both a state and local level. Thus, Utah landlords are able to charge whatever they want for rent."
"Rental increases. By the same token, Utah landlords are not limited in how much they can raise rent and they are not required to give notice or justification before doing so."
Rent-related fees. Utah law does not limit late fees and they do not even have to disclose all fees in the lease agreement. The state does limit returned check fees to $30.
