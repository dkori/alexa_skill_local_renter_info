"Rent control. Massachusetts law preempts all rent control policies at a state and local level. As such, landlords can charge whatever they wish in rental prices."
Rental increases. Landlords in Massachusetts must give at least 30 daysâ€™ notice before raising rental prices. Tenants can disagree with the rental increase and unconditionally break their lease.
"Rent-related fees. The state does not put a limit on late rental fees but there is a $30 limit on returned check fees. Also, the law strictly limits what kind of fees landlords can charge at the beginning and end of a tenancy."
