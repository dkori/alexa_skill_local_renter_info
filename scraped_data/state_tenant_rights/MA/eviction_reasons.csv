eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant does not pay rent by the due date, then a Massachusetts landlord may file a 14-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If the tenant still does not pay within 14 days, then the landlord may pursue formal eviction."
"Lease violation - Massachusetts law does not require landlords to give advance notice in the case of lease violations. As such, if a lease violation occurs, tenants may face immediate eviction without notice."
"Illegal acts - Massachusetts landlords have broad authority to determine which illegal acts warrant eviction. If a landlord has documentation of illegal activities on the premises, they may file for immediate eviction."
