eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant fails to pay rent, then the landlord may issue a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit, after any applicable grace period. If the terms of the notice are not met then the landlord may initiate formal eviction proceedings."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs then the landlord may immediately send a notice to quit. It is customary for landlords to give 3 days to fix the issue but not required. If the terms of the notice are not met, then the landlord may file for eviction."
"Illegal acts - If the landlord has documentation of illegal activities on the premises, then they may file a 3-Day Notice to Quit. If the violation involves public indecency, then the landlord may terminate the lease without prior notice."
