"Rent control. Current state law prohibits any kind of policy that would amount to rent control on both a state and local level. As such, landlords in Texas can charge whatever they want for rental prices."
Rental increases. Texas landlords are not required to give prior notice before raising the rent and are not limited in how much they raise rental prices.
Rent-related fees.  The state neither limits late fees nor returned check fees so landlords can charge what they wish.
