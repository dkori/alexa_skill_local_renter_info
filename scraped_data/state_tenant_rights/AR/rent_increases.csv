Rent control. Arkansas does not have any form of rent control so landlords can set rental prices to whatever they want.
"Rent increases. Arkansas landlords are not limited in how much they can raise rental prices, but they are prohibited from raising rent for discriminatory reasons or as retaliation."
"Rent-related fees. Late fee charges are not regulated by Arkansas law although landlords have to wait at least 5 days before applying them. Returned check fees have a limit between $10-$16, depending on the reason it bounced."
