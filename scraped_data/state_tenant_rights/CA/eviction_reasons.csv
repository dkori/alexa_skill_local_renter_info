eviction_reasons
Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant fails to pay rent by the due date then the landlord may serve a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If rent is still not paid after those 3 days then the landlord may file for eviction.
Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs then the landlord may issue a 3-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. If the tenant fails to fix the issue then the landlords may file a Summons Complaint for Unlawful Detainer.
"Illegal acts - If a landlord has documentation of illegal activity occurring on the premise then they may file a 3-Day Unconditional Notice to Quit. If the tenant does not leave, then the landlord may pursue formal eviction. California law does not explicitly enumerate illegal activities that warrant an eviction."
