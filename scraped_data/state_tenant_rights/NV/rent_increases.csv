"Rent control. Nevada state law does not prohibit or enforce rent control. As such, landlords may charge what they wish for rent. The state has the “Dillon Rule” which forbids local jurisdictions from unilaterally instituting rent control policies without state approval."
"Rental increases. Landlords are not limited in how much they can raise the rent, but they must give tenants at least 45 days’ notice. If the period of tenancy is less than 1 month then the landlord only needs to give 15 days’ notice."
Rent-related fees. The state does not put a limit on late fees for rent. They also do not regulate returned check fees.
