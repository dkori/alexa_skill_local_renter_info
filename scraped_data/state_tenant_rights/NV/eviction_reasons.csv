eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant fails to pay rent, then the landlord may issue a 7-day Notice to Pay or Quit, after any applicable grace period. If the tenant still does not pay after 7 days, then the landlord may proceed with formal eviction."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs then the landlord may issue a 5-Day Notice to Cure or Quit which outlines how the tenant can fix their behavior. If the issue is severe enough, the landlord does not need to give the tenant the chance to remedy the issue. Either way, if the terms of the notice are not met, the landlord may pursue eviction."
"Illegal acts - If a Nevada landlord has documentation of illegal activity on the property, then they may issue a 3-Day Notice to Quit. Damaging the property, subleasing in violation of the lease, running an unlawful business, and illegal substance use or manufacture are grounds for eviction in Nevada."
