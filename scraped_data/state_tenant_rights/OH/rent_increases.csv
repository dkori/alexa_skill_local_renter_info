"Rent control. Ohio law neither prohibits nor enforces statutes that effectively amount to rent control. As such, landlords are currently free to charge as much they wish for rent. However, it is possible that Ohio may adopt some kind of rent control policies in the future."
Rent increases. Ohio does not require landlords to notify or provide justification before raising rental prices.
"Rent-related fees. Ohio landlords can set whatever fees they wish, provided they are included in the lease agreement. Ohio law limits returned check fees to $10 of 10% of the checkâ€™s value, whichever is larger."
