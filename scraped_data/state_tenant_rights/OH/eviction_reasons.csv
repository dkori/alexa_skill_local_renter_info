eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant does not make a rental payment, landlords may issue a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If the tenant still does not pay, then the landlord can proceed with formal evictions."
"Violation of lease terms - If a lease violation occurs, Ohio landlords can issue a 3-Day Notice to Quit. The landlord may include provisions for remedying the issue but they are not required to. Either way, a landlord can proceed with eviction 3 days after giving the notice."
"Illegal Acts - Generally, landlords may follow the same procedure as lease violations for evicting tenants for illegal acts. Two criminal acts are grounds for immediate eviction without notice: using/selling/making drugs on the property or living within 1,000 feet of a school while being on the state sex offender registry."
