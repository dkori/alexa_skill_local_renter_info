"Nonpayment of rent - If an Indiana tenant fails to pay rent, then the landlord may issue a 10-Day Notice to Pay or Quit after any applicable grace period. If the tenant still does not pay, then the landlord can start eviction proceedings."
"Violation of lease terms - If a lease violation has occurred, then the landlord may issue a 10-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. If the tenant fails to remedy the issue within 10 days, the landlord may start eviction proceedings."
"Illegal acts - Landlords have broad discretion to determine evictions for illegal activities, and may even include acts that are not explicitly illegal. If a tenant is engaged in illegal activity on the property, then the landlord can issue an Unconditional Notice to Quit."
