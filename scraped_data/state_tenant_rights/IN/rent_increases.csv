"Rent control. Indiana law precludes local legislation that amounts to rent control. As such, landlords can set rental prices as high as they want."
Rent increases. There are no limits to how much Indian landlords can raise rent but state law requires landlords to give tenants at least 30 days of written notice before raising rental prices.
Rent-related fees. Indiana has no limits on how much landlords can charge in late fees. The state does mandate a $25 returned check fee.
