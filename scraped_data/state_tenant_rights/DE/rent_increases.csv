"Rent control. Delaware does not currently enforce or prohibit rent control policies. As it stands, landlords are free to charge what they want in rental prices."
"Rental increases. Landlords must provide 60 daysâ€™ notice before raising rental prices, and the tenant has 15 days to accept or refuse. If they refuse, they must move out after the 60 days have passed."
Rent-related fees. Late rent fees cannot exceed 5% of the total rental price for the payment period. This fee can only be charged after a state-mandated 5-day grace period.
