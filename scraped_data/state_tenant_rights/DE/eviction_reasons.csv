eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If a Delaware tenant fails to pay rent then the landlords may issue a 5-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If they do not pay, then the landlord may file for eviction."
Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs then the landlord may provide a written 7-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. If the tenant fails to abide by the terms of the notice then the landlords may pursue eviction. Landlords do not need to provide any notice for second violations.
"Illegal acts - If a qualifying illegal act is committed on the premises, then the landlord may pursue immediate eviction."
