Rent control. Iowa law preempts any form of rent control at either a state or local level so landlords can set rental prices to whatever they want.
Rent increases. Landlords must notify tenants at least 30 days before raising the rent but landlords do not have to give justification for raising rent.
Rent-related fees. Landlords who charge $700 or less in rent are limited to a $12/day late fee. Landlords that charge more than $700 can charge $20 per day.
