"Rent control. Michigan law preempts any kind of rent control at both a state and local level. Therefore, Michigan landlords can charge whatever they want in rent."
Rental increases. Landlords do not need to justify or give notice before raising rent and they are not limited in how much they raise rent.
Rent-related fees. Late fees are not regulated but there is a $25 returned check fee limit ($30 if the fee is paid after 7 days).
