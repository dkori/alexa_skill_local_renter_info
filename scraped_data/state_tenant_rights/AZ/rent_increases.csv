Rent control. Arizona law does not have provisions for rent control so landlords are allowed to set rental prices however high they wish.
"Rental increases. Landlords also are not limited in how much they can raise rent and they do not need to give prior notice to raise rent. However, they must wait until the next rental period before the rent hike goes into effect."
Rent-related fees. The state does not put a limit on late fees but there is a $25 limit on returned check fees.
