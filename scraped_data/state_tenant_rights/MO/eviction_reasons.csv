eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - Missouri does not require landlords to issue a notice in the case of missing rental payments after any applicable grace period. As such, landlords can pursue immediate eviction if rent is not paid."
"Violation of lease terms - If a lease violation occurs, Missouri landlords may issue a 10-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. If the issue is not remedied in the specified timeframe, landlords can pursue eviction. Some violations are serious enough to warrant immediate eviction."
"Illegal acts - If a landlord has documentation of prostitution, illegal gambling, assault, or possession/sale of drugs occurring on their property they may file a 10-Day Notice to Quit. If the tenant does not vacate the premises, the landlord can file an Unlawful Detainer suit."
