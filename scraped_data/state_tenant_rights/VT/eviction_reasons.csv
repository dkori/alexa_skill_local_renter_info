"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant fails to pay rent then the landlord may issue a 30-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If the tenant does not pay within the timeframe, then the landlord may initiate formal eviction proceedings."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs, then the landlord may issue a 30-Day Notice to Quit. Landlords do not have to give a chance for the tenants to fix the issue, although it is customary to do so. If the tenant does not meet the terms, then the landlord can pursue formal eviction."
Illegal acts - Illegal activities such as violent crime and illegal drug use can be grounds for a 14-Day Unconditional Notice to Quit. Tenants must move out within 2 weeks or face formal eviction proceedings.
