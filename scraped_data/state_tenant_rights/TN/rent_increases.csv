"Rent control. State law prohibits local jurisdiction from passing ordinances that control the amount of rent charged for commercial or residential properties. Thus, Tennessee landlords can charge whatever they want for rent."
"Rental increases. Similarly, there are no limits on rental increases. Tennessee landlords can raise the rent by however much they want and whenever they want, without giving advance notice."
Rent-related fees. Landlords are limited to charging no more than 10% of the missing amount in late fees. There is also a $30 returned check limit.
