"Non-payment of rent - If a North Carolina tenant does not pay rent when it’s due, landlords may issue a 10-day Notice to Pay or Quit. If the tenant does not pay within 10 days, landlords can pursue legal eviction."
"Violation of lease terms - If a North Carolina tenant violates the terms of their lease agreement, then landlords may issue an unconditional Notice to Quit. If the terms are not met by the date listed, then landlords can pursue eviction."
Illegal acts - Landlords who have documentation of illegal acts committed by tenants can pursue “Article 7 eviction” to expedite the eviction process. Article 7 eviction can take effect immediately.
