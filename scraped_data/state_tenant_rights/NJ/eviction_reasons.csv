eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If a New Jersey tenant fails to pay rent then the landlord is not required to give any kind of notice. As such, tenants who fail to pay rent may face immediate eviction. The landlord can also issue a 30-Day Notice to Pay or Quit."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs then the landlord must first issue a warning. If the violation is not addressed, then the landlord may issue a 30-Day Notice to Quit. If the terms of the lease are not met then the landlord may pursue formal eviction."
"Illegal acts - In case of illegal behavior, New Jersey landlords may issue a 3-Day Notice to Quit. This notice is warranted for illegal drug use/possession, assault, willful destruction of property, and disorderly conduct."
