Rent control. New Jersey allows local jurisdictions to enact rent control policies. More than 100 municipalities in New Jersey have some kind of rent control policies. You can check with your local housing authority for more information in your locale.
"Rental increases. In places where rent control is active, Landlords must justify and provide at least 30 days’ notice before raising rental prices. Tenants must be allowed to quit their lease without further conditions if they disagree with the rental hike."
"Rent-related fees. The state does not limit late rental fees provided that they are clearly outlined in the lease agreement. Landlords may also charge returned check fees, but only after they wait 35 days and may only charge a $100 fee or a fee equal to 3 times the check’s value (but not exceeding $500)."
