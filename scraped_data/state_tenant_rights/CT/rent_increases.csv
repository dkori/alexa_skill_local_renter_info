"Rent control. Connecticut law explicitly prohibits rent control policies on a state or local level. As such, Connecticut landlords are free to charge what they wish in rental prices."
"Rental increases. Under current law, landlords are not required to give any prior notice before raising rental prices. However, fair rent commissions are permitted under state law."
"Rent-related fees. Connecticut landlords may charge late rent fees, but only after a state-mandated 9-day grace period. The value of these fees is not limited by law, though. The state does prohibit returned check fees."
