"Failure to vacate at the end of a lease - If a lease ends, tenants must immediately vacate the premises. If they do not, the landlord may file for eviction immediately."
"Nonpayment of rent - If a Connecticut tenant fails to pay rent then the landlord may issue them a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If they do not pay by the end of the 3 days, then the landlord may initiate formal eviction proceedings."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs, then the landlord may issue a 15-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. If the terms of the notice are not met, then the landlord may begin eviction proceedings."
"Illegal acts - Connecticut law highlights several illegal activities that are grounds for eviction, including prostitution, illegal gambling, and illegal sale of alcohol or drugs. If a landlord has documentation of illegal activities occurring on the property, then they may issue a 30-Day Unconditional Notice to Quit."
