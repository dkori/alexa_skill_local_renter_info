eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant fails to pay rent by the due date, landlords can issue a 7-Day Notice to Pay. If the tenant does not pay within 7 days of receiving the notice, landlords can commence eviction proceedings."
"Violation of lease terms - Kentucky landlords may issue a 15-Day Notice to Cure for first-time curable lease violations. If the same infraction occurs again within 6 months, Kentucky landlords can skip the 15-day Notice to Cure and file a 14-Day Unconditional Notice to Quit that requires immediate eviction."
Illegal acts - Kentucky law does not explicitly demarcate which criminal acts are justification for eviction. Landlords can determine these conditions in individual lease agreements.
