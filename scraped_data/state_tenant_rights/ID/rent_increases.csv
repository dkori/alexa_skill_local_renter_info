Rent control. Idaho does not currently enforce any kind of rent control so landlords are able to charge whatever they want in rental prices.
Rental increases. Idaho landlords are not limited in how much they can raise rental prices but they must give tenants at least 15 daysâ€™ advance notice before doing so.
"Rent-related fees. The state does not limit how much landlords can charge late fees. Returned check fees are limited to 3 times the value of the check or $100, whichever is greater."
