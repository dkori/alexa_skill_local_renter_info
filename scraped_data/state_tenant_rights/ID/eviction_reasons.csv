eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If an Idaho tenant fails to pay rent then the landlord can issue a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If the tenant still refuses to pay, then the landlord may file a Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs then the landlord may issue a 3-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. In cases of serious violations, the landlord is not required to give a chance to remedy. Either way, if the tenant does not agree to the terms, then the landlord may file for eviction."
"Illegal acts - Idaho landlords may choose which illegal acts warrant eviction. To that end, Idaho landlords can issue a 24-hour Notice to Vacate if they have documentation of illegal activities on the property."
