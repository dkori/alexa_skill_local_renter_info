"Rent control. New York has statewide rent control policies and different municipalities can partake in a “rent stabilization” program. Under these programs, local jurisdictions are empowered to set local rental prices for units built after 1971."
"Rental increases. New York state law does not require landlords to give prior notice before raising rental prices, though individual lease agreements might have such requirements."
"Rent-related fees. Late fees are not limited by the state but returned check fees are capped at $20 per instance, but only if it is included in the lease agreement."
