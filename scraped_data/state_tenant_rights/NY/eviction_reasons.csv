eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant fails to pay rent then the landlord may issue a 14-Day Notice to Pay or Quit, after any applicable grace period. If the tenant still does not pay, then the landlord may begin formal eviction proceedings."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs then the landlord may issue a 10-Day Notice to Cure. If the issue is not fixed within 10 days, then the landlord can issue a further 30-Day Notice to Quit. If the tenant does not vacate the property, then the landlord may begin formal eviction proceedings."
Illegal acts - New York landlords have broad authority to determine which illegal activities warrant eviction. New York tenants can face immediate eviction if the landlord has documentation of illegal activities occurring on the premises.
