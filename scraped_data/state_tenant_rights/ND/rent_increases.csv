"Rent control. Current North Dakota law preempts any kind of rent control policy on either a state or local level. As such, landlords can charge whatever they want for rent."
Rental increases. Landlords are not limited in how much they raise rent but they must first give tenants 30 daysâ€™ advance notice.
"Rent-related fees. There are no limits on late fee charges, as long as they are explicitly included in the lease agreements. There is a $40 returned check fee limit."
