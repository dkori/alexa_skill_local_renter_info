Rent control. Maine law neither preempts nor enforces rent control policies. Landlords are currently free to charge whatever they wish in rental prices but local jurisdictions could enact rent control policies.
Rental increases. Maine landlords must provide at least 45 daysâ€™ written notice before raising the rent but they are not limited in how much they raise rental prices.
"Rent-related fees. Late fees are capped at 4% of the owed rental amount and can only be applied if they were included in the lease agreement. Returned check fees cannot exceed the total cost of the amount due, court costs, service costs, and collection costs."
