"Rent control. New Hampshire law prohibits local jurisdiction from passing rent contour policies. As such, landlords are free to charge what they want in rental prices."
Rental increases. Landlords are not limited in how much they raise rental prices but they must give at least 30 daysâ€™ notice before doing so.
Rent-related fees. State laws do not put a cap on late fees but returned check fees are limited to the face value of the check plus processing fees as a penalty.
