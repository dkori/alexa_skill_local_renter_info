eviction_reasons
"Failure to Pay Rent - Rent is due on the day specified in the lease agreement. If it is not paid at that time, a Washington landlord may issue a 14-Day Notice to Pay. The tenant can pay the past due amount within 14 days to avoid eviction."
"Violation of Lease Terms - Washington tenants must meet the obligations of their lease at all times. If their landlord observes that they have not, they may issue a 10-Day Notice to Comply that provides terms for remedying the infraction."
"Illegal Acts - Washington state allows landlords to determine what types of illegal acts justify eviction. In any case, evictions filed for this reason must be preceded by a 3-Day Notice to Quit."
