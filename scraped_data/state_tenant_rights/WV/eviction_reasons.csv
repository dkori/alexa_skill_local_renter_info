eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - There are no laws surrounding nonpayment of rent so if West Virginia tenants fail to pay rent then landlords can immediately evict them, they are not required to give notice or allow for repayment."
Violation of lease terms - West Virginia landlords are similarly not required to give any notice to cure for a lease violation. They can evict a tenant immediately if they violate the lease.
Illegal Acts - West Virginia landlords are free to determine whether illegal activity warrants an eviction. They do not need to give any notice to evict.
