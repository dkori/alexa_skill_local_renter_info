"Rent control. West Virginia law neither sanctions nor prohibits ordinances that would effectively amount to rent control. Thus, landlords can set whatever rental prices they want."
Rental increases. West Virginia law does not require landlords to give notice or justification before raising rent and does not limit rent increases.
"Rent-related fees. West Virginia law does not place any limits on late fees as long as they are included in the rental agreement. However, the state does limit returned check fees to $25."
