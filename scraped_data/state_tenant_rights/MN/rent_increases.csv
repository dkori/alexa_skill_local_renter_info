"Rent control. Minnesota law preempts any type of rent control at a state or local level. So, landlords can charge whatever they want for rent."
"Rental increases. Similarly, landlords are not prohibited from raising rental prices as much as they want, but they must give at least 1 month +1 day or notice but they do not have to give a justification."
Rent-related fees. Late fees are capped at 8% of the total value of the rental payment. There is no limit for returned check fees.
