eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - Minnesota law does not require landlords to give tenants a notice to pay in the case of late rent. Thus, if a tenant does not pay rent, then the landlord can be served with an eviction notice after any applicable grace period."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs, then landlords may notify the tenants and provide instructions on how to remedy the problem. Minnesota law does not require this though so landlords can immediately evict tenants for lease violations without notice."
"Illegal acts - Similarly, eviction for illegal actions require no advanced notice. Illegal activities that warrant eviction in Minnesota include drug manufacture, prostitution, illegal gambling, and possessing an illegal firearm."
