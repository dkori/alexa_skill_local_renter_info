"Rent control. Florida law does not have statewide rent control, meaning a landlord can charge as much as they want."
"Raising rent. Florida landlords can raise rent for any reason (after any fixed terms are completed), and can do so as often they want. The amount of notice needed before raising rent depends on how often rent is paid (i.e. 15 days notice for month-to-month leases)."
"Additional fees. There are no limits on the amount of application or late rent fees a landlord can charge. However, there are limits on bounced check fees ($25 to 5%, depending on check amount)."
