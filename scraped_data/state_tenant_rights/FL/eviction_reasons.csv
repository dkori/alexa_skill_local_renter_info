"Failure to Pay Rent - if rent is late (the day after itâ€™s due, unless the lease states otherwise), a landlord may give the tenant a written 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit."
"No Lease / End of Lease Term - if the lease period has ended or the tenant has no lease, a landlord may serve the tenant with a written lease termination notice (15 day notice if paying month-to-month)."
"Violation of Lease Terms - if the tenant does not uphold both their responsibilities under the lease and their obligations under landlord tenant law, a landlord may give them either a written 7 Day Notice to Cure or Vacate or a 7 Day Unconditional Quit Notice, depending on the severity of the violation."
