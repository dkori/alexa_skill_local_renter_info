"Rent control. Nebraska law neither enforces nor prohibits rent control. As such, landlords can charge whatever they want for rental prices, but rent control policies could be instituted in the future."
"Rental increases. In the absence of a lease provision stating so, landlords are not required to provide advanced notice before raising the rent and there is no limit to how high they can raise rental prices."
Rent-related fees. Landlords can charge whatever fees they want as long as they are included in the lease agreement. Returned check fees are limited to $10.
