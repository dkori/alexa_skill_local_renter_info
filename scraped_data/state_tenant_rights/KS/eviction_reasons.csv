eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - if a tenant fails to pay rent within the first three months, then the landlord may issue a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If the tenant has rented for more than 3 months the landlord may file a 10-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. In both cases, if rent goes unpaid then the landlord can pursue formal eviction."
"Violation of lease terms - if a lease violation occurs, then landlords may issue a 14/30-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. The tenant must fix their behavior within 14 days. If they fail to do so then they must move out in the next 30 days."
"Illegal acts - Kansas landlords have generally broad authority to determine which illegal acts are grounds for eviction. If an illegal activity occurs, the landlord may pursue immediate eviction."
