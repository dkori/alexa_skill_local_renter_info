"Rent control. Kansas law does not allow for rent control at either a state or local level. As such, Kansas landlords can charge as much as they want for rent."
"Rental increases. Landlords must provide at least 30 daysâ€™ written notice before raising rent, though they are not limited in how much they can raise."
Rent-related fees. Kansas law does not put a limit on late fee penalties as long as they are in the lease agreement. Kansas does limit returned check fees to $30.
