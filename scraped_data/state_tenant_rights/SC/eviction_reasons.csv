eviction_reasons
"Failure to pay rent - If a tenant does not pay rent, South Carolina landlords can issue a 5 Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If they do not pay, then the landlord can begin eviction. However, South Carolina law allows landlords to eliminate this obligation."
"Violation of lease terms - if a violation of the lease has occurred, landlords can issue a 14-day Notice to Cure. If the tenant does not address the issue in the specified 14 days, the landlord can begin eviction proceedings."
Illegal acts - South Carolina landlords are allowed to pursue immediate eviction if they have evidence of illegal activity on the premises. Landlords are not required to give tenants a timeframe to remedy the behavior.
