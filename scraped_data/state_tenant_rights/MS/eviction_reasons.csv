eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If rent is late, landlords can give a 3-day Notice to Pay or Quit. If the tenant does not pay within 3 days, the landlord can engage in eviction proceedings. Landlords are free to give tenants a grace period for late rent, either in a lease agreement or at their discretion."
"Violation of lease term - If a tenant violates the terms of their lease or does not abide by their responsibilities as a tenant, landlords can issue a 30-day Notice to Remedy. If the terms are not met or the problem is not remediable, then landlords can proceed with eviction."
"Illegal acts - Mississippi law does not specify guidelines for eviction due to illegal acts. Thus, Mississippi landlords can establish their own eviction notice policies for documented illegal acts."
