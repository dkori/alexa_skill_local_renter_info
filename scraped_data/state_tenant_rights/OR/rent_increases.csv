"Rent control. Oregon is one of the few states in the US that has statewide rent control policies. However, this rent control does not necessarily apply to raw rental prices but rental increases."
"Rental increases. Oregon landlords are not allowed to raise rent more than 7% annually, except for units that are less than 15 years old. Landlords must also provide at least 30 days’ notice before raising rent as well."
Rent-related fees. Landlords may either charge a “reasonable” flat rate or up to 5% the missing rent value each day payment is late. Returned check fees are limited to $35 per check-instance.
