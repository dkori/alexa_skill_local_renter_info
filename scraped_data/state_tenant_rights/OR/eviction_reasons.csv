eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If an Oregon tenant fails to pay rent, then the landlord may issue a 72-hour Notice to Pay or Quit, after a 7 day grace period has passed. Oregon landlords may also opt for a 5 day grace period and then issue a 144-hour Notice to Pay. Either way, if the tenant does not pay, then the landlord may proceed with eviction."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs, then the landlord may issue a 30-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. If the tenant does not fix their behavior by then, the landlord may pursue legal eviction."
"Illegal acts - Some illegal acts entitle landlords to evict within 24 hours, such as making or using illegal drugs, falsifying documents related to illegal activity, and prostitution on the property. The landlord may issue a 24-hour Unconditional Notice to Quit."
