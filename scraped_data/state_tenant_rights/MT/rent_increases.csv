"Rent control. Rent control policies are neither enforced nor preempted by Montana law. As such, landlords can charge whatever they want for rent, although rent control policies may be instituted in the future."
Rental increases. Landlords in Montana are not limited in how much they can raise rental prices and they are not required to give notice or justification for hiking rental rates unless that is included in the lease agreement.
Rent-related fees. The state does not limit late fees but there is a $30 return check fee limit.
