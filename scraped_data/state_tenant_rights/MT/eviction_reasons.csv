"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant fails to pay rent, then the landlord may issue a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit after any applicable grace period. If the tenant still does not pay then the landlord may begin eviction proceedings."
"Lease violation - In the case of a lease violation, the landlord may issue a Notice to Cure or Quit. Landlords may choose how much time the notice gives tenants to 1, 3, or 14 days, depending on the severity of the infraction. Landlords only have to give a 5-Day notice for repeated infractions."
"Illegal acts - Montana landlords have broad authority to determine which types of illegal activities warrant eviction. The landlord may issue a 5-Day Unconditional Notice to Quit. If the tenant does not vacate the premises, then the landlord can file for eviction."
