eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant misses a rental payment, landlords must give a 7-day pay notice. Failure to pay within this 7-day window can be grounds for eviction."
"Violation of lease terms - If a tenant violates a lease, landlords must provide a 14-day notice requesting they remedy their behavior. Landlords can then file a 7-Day Additional Quit Notice before filing for eviction with a court."
Illegal acts - Illegal acts can serve as justification for eviction following the issuance of a 7-day termination notice. Criminal acts warrant the same eviction process as a regular lease violation.
