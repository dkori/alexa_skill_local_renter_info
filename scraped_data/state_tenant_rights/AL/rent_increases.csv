"Rent control - Alabama does not have any rent control laws, so landlords can charge whatever they want for rent."
Increases - Alabama landlords are legally allowed to raise rent without providing notice. Tenants and landlords can agree on specific rental increase notices in the terms of the lease. Landlords cannot raise rents in a discriminatory manner against a protected class.
Additional fees - Landlords are generally allowed to charge late fees after the grace period for missing rent. The state does not cap late fees.
