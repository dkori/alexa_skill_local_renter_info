"Rent control & increases. Virginia law explicitly prohibits counties and local governments from passing ordinances that amount to rent control. Thus, Virginia landlords can charge as much as they want for rent."
"Rent increases. Similarly, Virginia does not require landlords to provide justification or notice before raising rent, and there is no limit to how much they can increase."
Rental related fees. There is no explicit limitation on late fees but precedent shows that courts will likely strike down late fees if they are not included in the lease agreement. Precedent also indicates that late fees must be commensurate with the cost the landlord has incurred. There is a $50 limit on returned check fees.
