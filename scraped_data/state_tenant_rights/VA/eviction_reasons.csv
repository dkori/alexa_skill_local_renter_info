eviction_reasons
"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant does not rent by the specified date, then a landlord may issue a 5 Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If the tenant does not pay within that time game, then the landlord may begin eviction proceedings."
"Violation of lease terms - If a tenant is violating the terms of the lease, then the landlord may issue a 30-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. If a tenant has received a previous notice about the same violation, then landlords are not required to give any chance to cure their behavior."
"Illegal Acts - If a landlord finds that a tenant is engaging in illegal acts, then they may immediately start evictions without any advanced notice. Virginia law may allow landlords to evict tenants for any illegal acts, even those not committed on the property."
