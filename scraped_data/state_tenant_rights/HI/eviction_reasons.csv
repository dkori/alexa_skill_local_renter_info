"Nonpayment of rent - If a tenant fails to pay rent then the landlord may issue a written 5-Day Notice to Pay or Quit. If the tenant still does not pay, then the landlord may begin formal eviction proceedings."
"Lease violation - If a lease violation occurs, then the landlord can issue a 10-Day Notice to Cure or Quit. If the terms of the notice are not met within the timeframe, then the landlord may file for eviction."
Illegal acts - Hawaii landlords have broad authority to determine which illegal acts warrant eviction. If a landlord has documentation of illegal activity on the property then they may file a 5-Day Notice to Quit before filing for eviction. Illegal actions that may harm the property or tenant can be grounds for immediate eviction.
