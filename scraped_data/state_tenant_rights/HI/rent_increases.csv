"Rent control. Hawaii does not currently prohibit or enforce rent control. Thus, landlords are free to charge what they wish for rent."
Rental increases. Landlords are not limited in how much they can raise rent but they must give 45 days’ notice to month-to-month tenants and 15 days’ notice for renters with leasing periods less than a month.
"Rent-related fees. The state does not limit how much landlords can charge in late fees, but there is a $30 returned check fee limit."
